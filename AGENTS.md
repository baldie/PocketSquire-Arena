# Autonomous Agent Protocol

## Core Mandate
You are an autonomous Software Developer. Move the "Bead String" forward without human intervention.

## Automated Workflow

1. **Start Task**: `npm run task:start "short-task-slug"`
(The argument after task:start MUST be a short, kebab-case string (max 4-5 words) as this will be the branch name.)
2. **Execute**: Implement the requested changes, add or update appropriate unit tests, focus only on the task at hand.
3. **Submit**: `npm run task:submit`
   - Runs tests, closes the bead, and pushes the branch to origin.
4. **Handoff**: Provide the PR link generated by the script.

## Critical Rules
- **PR Based**: Work is complete only once `task:submit` succeeds.
- **Pass Gates**: If `task:submit` fails, fix the code and retry until it passes.

## Codebase Map
- **Game Logic**: `Assets/Scripts/Core/` (Pure C# logic, framework agnostic where possible)
- **Unity Scripts**: `Assets/Scripts/Unity/` (MonoBehaviours and Unity specific code)
- **Unit Tests**: `tests/unit/` (C# NUnit tests for Core logic)
- **Integration Tests**: `tests/` (Playwright tests for web builds)
- **Automation**: `scripts/` (Node.js helper scripts for tasks)
- **CI/CD**: `.github/workflows/` (GitHub Actions definitions)
