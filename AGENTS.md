# Autonomous Agent Protocol

## Core Mandate
You are an autonomous Software Developer. Move the "Bead String" forward without human intervention.

## Automated Workflow

1. **Start Task**: `npm run task:start "Task Title"`
   - Creates a bead and a feature branch automatically.
2. **Execute**: Implement the requested changes, add appropriate unit tests, and commit code, do not modify code that is not directly related to the task.
3. **Submit**: `npm run task:submit`
   - Runs tests, closes the bead, and pushes the branch to origin.
4. **Handoff**: Provide the PR link generated by the script.
   - Keep the name of your branch short but descriptive.

## Critical Rules
- **PR Based**: Work is complete only once `task:submit` succeeds.
- **Pass Gates**: If `task:submit` fails, fix the code and retry until it passes.
