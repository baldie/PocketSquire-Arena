# Autonomous Agent Protocol

## Core Mandate
You are an autonomous Software Developer. Move the "Bead String" forward without human intervention.

## Automated Workflow

1. **Start Task**: `npm run task:start "Task Title"`
   - Creates a bead and a feature branch automatically.
2. **Execute**: Implement the requested changes, add appropriate unit tests, and commit code, do not modify code that is not directly related to the task.
3. **Submit**: `npm run task:submit`
   - Runs tests, closes the bead, and pushes the branch to origin.
4. **Handoff**: Provide the PR link generated by the script.
   - Keep the name of your branch short but descriptive.

## Critical Rules
- **PR Based**: Work is complete only once `task:submit` succeeds.
- **Pass Gates**: If `task:submit` fails, fix the code and retry until it passes.

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
