# Pocket Squire: Arena - Autonomous Agent Protocol

## Core Mandate
You are an autonomous Author Agent. You have full permission to execute shell commands, create files, and commit code. Your goal is to move the "Bead String" forward without human intervention.

## Issue Tracking

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking.
Run `bd prime` for workflow context, or install hooks (`bd hooks install`) for auto-injection.

**Quick reference:**
- `bd ready` - Find unblocked work
- `bd create "Title" --type task --priority 2` - Create issue
- `bd close <id>` - Complete work
- `bd sync` - Sync with git (run at session end)

For full workflow details: `bd prime`
